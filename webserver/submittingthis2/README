What works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The webserver works by accepting both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 requests and responds
in the proper manner. 

Meminfo and meminfo callbacks work in all cases and responds in json format.

Loadavg and its callback works in all cases and responds in json format.

The server deals files, including jpg images and gif as well as the required css, js
and html files.

Runloop successfully runs and adjusts the load average.

Allocanon successful allocates memory.

Freeanon successful removes the last block given.

Responds to bad requests with the proper HTTP message in the correct format.

Supports multiple client support by use of threading. 

All errors are caught so that one error does not shut down the entire server.

Works for IPV6.

Widgets can be run and are loaded and update regularly. 


Design
==========================

The server itself works by opening up sockets and listening for requests. When a request is received it 
creates a thread and calls the function with the necessary paraments. From there it calls the function and begins
using the file descriptor. It uses the file descriptor to communicate. It parses the data sent across the 
file descriptor and breaks it down based on several factors. First it determines if it is a GET request, then the
address it is looking for and the version of HTTP. From there it performs the correct actions based on the request
and responds in formatted HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 responses. Many of the functions are broken down into their own files
to distribute the code.

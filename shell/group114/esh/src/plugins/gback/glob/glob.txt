The 'glob' esh plug-in
-----------------------

The 'glob' plug-in provides glob (wildcard) expansion for esh.

It implements the 'process_pipeline' method, iterates through
all commands in each pipeline, and replaces each argv[i] element
with its glob expansion using glob(3).

The plug-in always frees the old cmd->argv array and allocates
a new array.

The plug-in will reuse the cmd->argv[i] if no glob expansion
occurs, else it will free cmd->argv[i] and allocate new memory
for the entries into which it is expanded.

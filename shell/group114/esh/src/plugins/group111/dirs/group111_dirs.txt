This plugin implements the dirs functionality. This allows the user to keep
a list of directories that can be jumped to easily. This is done by using the
following commands:

	dirs, pushd, popd

dirs [-cpv]
	Without options, this displays a list of all the directories currently
	being stored in the list. The default display is all in one line 
	seperated by spaces. Directories are added with pushd and removed with
	popd.
	-c	Clears the list.
	-p	Displays each directory on a seperate line.
	-v	Displays each directory on a seperate line and numbers each
		directory.

pushd [dir]
	Adds the directory to the top of the stack and makes it the current
	working directory.
pushd
	When used without arguments, the first two directories in the list will
	be swapped, making the old second element the new current working
	directory.

pushd [+n] [-n]
	+n	Rotates the stack so that the nth directory from the left,
		starting at 0, is the new top of the stack and current working
		directory.
	-n	Rotates the stack so that the nth directory from the right,
		with 0 being the last directory in the list, is the new top
		of the stack and current working directory.

popd
	When used without arguments popd will remove the top directory on the
	stack, and make the new top of the stack the current working directory.

popd [+n] [-n]
	+n	Removes the nth directory from the left, with 0 being the first
		directory.
	-n	Removes the nth directory from the right, with 0 being the last
		directory.
